# Amazon_Echo_reviews_analysis
 Project realised for the Computational Social Science exam of the Master in Data Science at the University of Trento.
 
Based on the reviews left on Amazon Shop after purchasing the Amazon Echo devices, I explored the uses and criticisms of customers by highlighting how these devices have changed their habits and which features were most appreciated for each model.
